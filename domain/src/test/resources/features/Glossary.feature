  Rule: A workout is a list of sets.

  Rule: A set is the combination of an exercise, repetitions, and repetition scheme.

    Example: A set can be _squats_ done for _three reps_ with just _body weight_.

    Example: A set can be _high knees_ done for _two reps_ each lasting _30 seconds_.

  Rule: A repetition scheme defines how each repetition is performed.

    Example: A weighted scheme has each repetition done with a specific weight.

    Example: A timed scheme has each repetition done for a specific amount of time.

    Example: A distance scheme has each repetition done for a specific distance.

    Example: A repetition scheme can be composed of multiple schemes.

  Rule: An exercise is a way to move the body from a start position through intermediary position(s) to an end position.

    Example: A squat is an exercise that starts with the knees and hips straight, through full flexion of both joints, and then end with the joints straight again.

  Rule: Weight is composed of three components: implement, implement weight, and plates per side.

    Example: An implement is free-form text identifying the specific equipment (e.g., "Olympic barbell", "Life Fitness chest press").

    Example: An implement weight is the weight of the specific piece of equipment (e.g., 20 kg for an Olympic barbell, 126 lb for a Life Fitness machine).

    Example: Plates per side is a list of individual weight plates loaded on one side of the barbell or machine (e.g., [45 lb, 25 lb, 5 lb]).

    Example: For a deadlift using an Olympic barbell (20 kg) with plates [45 lb, 25 lb, 5 lb] per side, the total weight is 20 kg + 2 Ã— (45 + 25 + 5) lb = 20 kg + 150 lb.

  Rule: A set can complete normally or reach technical failure.

    Example: Normal completion is when the target reps are achieved with full range of motion maintained throughout.

    Example: Technical failure is when range of motion is reduced compared to the first rep in the set. The number of reps completed before technical failure must be recorded.
